# Frontend Header Responsive Styling & Optimization

## Overview
The `FrontendHeaderResponsive` is a core UI navigation component for the Stellar Raise platform. It provides a highly optimized, fully responsive header including a brand logo, navigation links, and a dynamic wallet connection status indicator. 

The primary goal of this implementation is to demonstrate strict "gas efficiency" at the React render layer. That means minimizing unnecessary re-renders utilizing modern React hooks (`useCallback`, `useMemo`), effectively reducing rendering overhead and browser reflow operations.

## Usage

```tsx
import { FrontendHeaderResponsive } from '../components/frontend_header_responsive';

function AppLayout() {
  const [walletConnected, setWalletConnected] = useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <FrontendHeaderResponsive 
        isWalletConnected={walletConnected} 
        onToggleMenu={(isOpen) => console.log('Mobile Menu Is Open:', isOpen)}
      />
      <main>
        {/* Page content here */}
      </main>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Props Reference
| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `isWalletConnected` | `boolean` | Yes | Controls the visual indicator for wallet connection. Toggles distinct UI indicators and color mappings (success green vs. error red). |
| `onToggleMenu` | `(isOpen: boolean) => void` | No | Callback fired when the mobile navigation toggle (hamburger menu) is clicked. Returns the actual active state of the menu. |

## "Gas Efficiency" Optimizations
- **useCallback**: The `handleToggleMenu` function is heavily memoized to prevent recreation across re-renders. This ensures that any child components relying on this reference won't spuriously re-render themselves.
- **useMemo**: The internal structure of the standard `navLinks` is memoized. Since this static list does not change shape, keeping it identically referenced allows React reconciliation to skip comparisons over it.
- **Direct CSS styling boundaries**: By strictly using React inline styling matched with our defined breakpoints (`md:hidden`, `md:flex` from `responsive.css`), the component responds visually without requiring complex Javascript `window.resize` tracking logic.

## Security
- Rendering links and labels are statically scoped strings. The component explicitly denies injecting any arbitrary HTML directly via properties like `innerHTML` or unchecked props, effectively halting basic XSS attack vectors at the header level.

## Testing Expectations
Standard component tests are available alongside in `frontend_header_responsive.test.tsx`. 
The test coverage focuses strictly on: 
1. The dynamic status changing (Connected vs Disconnected indicators).
2. The internal isolated operation of the Toggle/Hamburger mechanism and verifying standard accessibility aria properties update successfully.
3. Verification that callbacks accurately dispatch parameters. 
Ensure coverage commands exceed 95% threshold natively.
