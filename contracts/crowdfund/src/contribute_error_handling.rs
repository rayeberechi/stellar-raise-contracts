//! contribute() error handling — deprecates old panic-based logic.
//!
//! All previously untyped panics in `contribute()` are now returned as typed
//! `ContractError` variants, enabling scripts and CI/CD pipelines to handle
//! errors programmatically.
//!
//! @notice  All error conditions that can arise during a contribution are
//!          represented as typed `ContractError` variants.  This module
//!          re-exports their numeric codes and provides off-chain helpers so
//!          scripts can map a raw error code to a human-readable description
//!          without embedding magic numbers.
//!
//! | Code | Variant              | Trigger                                          |
//! |------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
//! |  2   | `CampaignEnded`      | `ledger.timestamp > deadline`                    |
//! |  6   | `Overflow`           | contribution or total_raised would overflow      |
//! |  8   | `ZeroAmount`         | `amount == 0`                                    |
//! |  9   | `BelowMinimum`       | `amount < min_contribution`                      |
//! | 10   | `CampaignNotActive`  | campaign status is not `Active`                  |
//!
//! # Deprecation notice
//!
//! The following panic-based guards have been **deprecated** and replaced with
//! typed errors:
//!
//! - `panic!("amount below minimum")` → `ContractError::BelowMinimum` (code 9)
//! - implicit zero-amount pass-through → `ContractError::ZeroAmount` (code 8)
//! - no status guard → `ContractError::CampaignNotActive` (code 10)
//!
//! # Security assumptions
//!
//! - `contributor.require_auth()` is called before any state mutation.
//! - Token transfer happens before storage writes; failures roll back atomically.
//! - Overflow is caught with `checked_add` on both per-contributor and global totals.
//! - The deadline check uses strict `>`, so contributions at exactly the deadline
//!   timestamp are accepted.
//! - Campaign status is checked first, so cancelled/successful campaigns are
//!   rejected before any other validation.
