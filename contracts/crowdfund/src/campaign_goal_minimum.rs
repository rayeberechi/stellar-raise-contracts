// campaign_goal_minimum — Minimum threshold enforcement for campaign goals.
//
// Security Assumptions:
// 1. MIN_GOAL_AMOUNT >= 1 closes the zero-goal drain exploit.
// 2. Negative goals are rejected by the < MIN_GOAL_AMOUNT comparison.
// 3. No integer overflow — only comparisons and saturating_add are used.
// 4. validate_goal_amount is called before any env.storage() write.
// 5. Constants are baked into WASM; changes require a contract upgrade.
