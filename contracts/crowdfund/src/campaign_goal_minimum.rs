//! @notice  This module provides the logic to prevent campaigns from being
//!          created with goals below a defined minimum, ensuring realistic
//!          fundraising targets and improving security.

///
/// @dev     The `_env` parameter is accepted for API consistency with other
///          Soroban validation helpers and to allow future ledger-aware
///          threshold logic (e.g. governance-controlled minimums stored in
///          contract storage) without a breaking signature change.

/// @param  _env         The Soroban environment (reserved for future use).
/// @param  goal_amount  The proposed campaign goal in token units.

///                      `Err(ContractError::GoalTooLow)` otherwise.
///
/// ## Security rationale
///
/// A campaign goal below `MIN_GOAL_AMOUNT` (currently 1 token unit) would:
/// - Allow a zero-goal campaign to be immediately "successful" after any
///   contribution, letting the creator drain funds with no real commitment.
/// - Create "dust" campaigns that consume a ledger entry for negligible value,
///   wasting network resources and increasing state bloat.
/// - Undermine platform credibility by permitting economically meaningless
///   campaigns that could be used for spam or griefing.
///
/// ## Integer-overflow safety
///
/// `goal_amount` is `i128`.  The comparison `goal_amount < MIN_GOAL_AMOUNT`
/// is a single signed integer comparison — no arithmetic is performed, so
/// overflow is impossible.
